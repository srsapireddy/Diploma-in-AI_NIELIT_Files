Open python interpreter and do the following.       

	1.Create an integer(32bit) array of shape 2,3
	
	2.Create another array using the values from the above array (Qno.1) but with a type of float64
 
	3.Create another array using the values from the above array (Qno.1) but with a type of int64
	
	4.Create another array using the values from the above array (Qno.1) but with a type of string
	
	5.Create another array using the values from the above array (Qno.4) but with a type of string

 
	6. create a 2 dimensional array conating 4 rows and 3 columns each and do different slicing operations and note your findings
		 	-> select first row  
			-> select third row
			-> select second column
		   	-> select first two elements of second and third rows
			-> select last element of each row
				etc.


	7.Create a numpy array(with a suitable shape) to store numbers from 11 to 50.
		using boolean indexing, replace all the numbers that are multiples of 5 with -1.
