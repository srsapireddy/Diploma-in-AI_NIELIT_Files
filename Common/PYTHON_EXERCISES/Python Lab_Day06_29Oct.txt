1. Write a menu based program that finds the value of a control variable 'con' based on the following equation
		
		con = a + 10bc - 5d / e.  

		The variables a,b,c,d and e are stored in a separate file (module).
		The values of these varables may be modified in the module file while the program is running.
		The main program should terminate upon receiving 0 as input.
		
	options are,
			
			1. Initialize
			2. Show 
			3. Reload
			0. Exit

		If option is 1, the module should be imported.
		If 2, the value of control variable should be displayed.
		If 3, the module should be reloaded.
2. Write a  program to create a file to store multiplication table for a number as per the following . 
	Get the number from user.
	Using list comprehension create a list  to contain the products.
	take each item from the list and write the same to a file in the following format
		
		1 X <input no> = <first item from list> 
		2 X <input no> = <second item from list> 		
		
		and so on.
   

3.Modify the above (Q.No.2) to accept filename and number via commandline arguments.
  (The script should not contain more than 3 lines including #! and import )
	syntax for giving the command is ,
    		 scriptname filename number.
    The multiplication table for the number should  be stored inside filename. 


 (hint: to get a formatted string you may use like,
  >>> x=10
  >>> y=20
  >>> s1='value of x is %d and value of y is %d'%(x,y)
  >>> print s1
      value of x is 10 and value of y is 20
  end of hint)
