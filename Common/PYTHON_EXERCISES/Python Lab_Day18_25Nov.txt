Open python interpreter and do the following(use numpy module).       


	1.Write a function to return the specified rows(of a 2D array) as another array of the same dimension.
	 (use fancy indexing)

	2.Write a function to return the specified columns(of a 2D array) as another array of the same dimension.
         (use fancy indexing)
 
	3.Write a function to return diagonal elements of an array(NxN) as another array.

	4.Write a function to return the number of occurences of a given element in a numpy array.

	5.Modify the above function (Q.No.1) to accept array of any shape and to return the 
 	    diagonal elements of the highest possible NxN array constructed from the given array. 

	6.Write a numPy program/function to create a 5x5 array to contain multiples of five starting from a given number.
	
	7.Write a function to return an nXn array of numbers (1,2,3,etc.) with diagonal elements set to nan.

	8.Write a function to return a numpy array by replacing nan with a given value for a given array.

	9.Write a funtion to add a border (filled with 0's) around an existing array.

	  eg.
		0000
		0110
		0110
		0000

	10.Write a function to return common values between two arrays as an array.

	11.Write a function to create a 2-D array whose diagonal equals [4, 5, 6, 8] and 0's elsewhere.

	12.Write a function to create a 2-D array whose diagonal equals some given values(variable arguments) and 0's elsewhere.
